<h2>
    A Woman of no Importance
</h2>
<h4> The narrative proper then begins with a description of Virginia’s upbringing: of her supportive father, of her demanding mother, and of her own powerful intentions to live life on her own terms. </h4>

   <!-- <p> That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
    leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
    space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
    absolutely worn to shadows.</p>  -->
    
    
    
    <h5>LADY HUNSTANTON</h5> 
    <p>[_Enter Servants with coffee_]</p> 
    <p>Worn to shadows, dear?</p>
    
    <h5>MRS. ALLONBY.</h5> 
    <p>It is such a strain keeping men upto the mark.They are always trying to escape from us.</p>
    
    <h5>LADY STUTFIELD</h5>
    <p>It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their power and use it.</p>
    
    <h5>LADY CAROLINE</h5>
    <p>[_Takes coffee from Servant_] </p>
    <p> What stuff and nonsense all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper place</p>
    
    <h5>MRS. ALLONBY</h5>  
    <p>But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?</p>
    
   <h5> MRS. ALLONBY</h5> 
   <p>[_Takes coffee from Servant_] </p>
   <p>Really?  And if they’re not married?</p>
    
    <h5>LADY CAROLINE</h5> 
    <p>If they are not married, they should be looking after a
    wife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going
    about society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry
    within twelve months.</p>
    
    <h5>LADY STUTFIELD</h5>
    <p>[_Refuses coffee_]</p>
    <p>But if they’re in love with some
    one who, perhaps, is tied to another?</p>
    
    <h5>LADY CAROLINE</h5> 
    <p>In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off
    in a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to
    meddle with other people’s property.</p>
